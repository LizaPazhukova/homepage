                    <p>
                      ― I'm the most successful person ever to run for the
                      presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more successful
                      than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross
                      Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci
                      store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and
                      haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know
                      it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                      fault.

                      Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan
                      Spitalny: no grades, certificates and other bureaucracy,
                      but program offered courses in real estate, asset
                      management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98%
                      students gave positive reviews while studying, however
                      some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against
                      Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                      million to settle that...
